--2.B. Runner and Customer Experience
--1.How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)

select ((registration_date- date '2021-01-01')/7)+1  as "week_no",
count(runner_id) as "Total_reg" from runners 
group by "week_no"
order by "Total_reg" desc

--2.What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?

select t2.runner_id,floor(avg(date_part('minute',t2.pickup_time-t1.order_time))) as "avg_minutes"
from customer_orders as t1 
join (select * from runner_orders where pickup_time is not null) as t2 
on t1.order_id = t2.order_id
group by t2.runner_id
order by "avg_minutes"

--3.Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

with temp1 as (
select t1.order_id,t1.order_time,t2.pickup_time,date_part('minute',t2.pickup_time-t1.order_time) as "avg_minutes"
from customer_orders as t1 
join (select * from runner_orders where pickup_time is not null) as t2 
on t1.order_id = t2.order_id
group by t1.order_id,t1.order_time,t2.pickup_time)
select avg(avg_minutes) as avg_time_taken from temp1;

--4.What was the average distance travelled for each customer?

select distinct t2.customer_id, 
cast(avg(t1.distance) over(PARTITION by t2.customer_id) as decimal(10, 2)) as Avg_Distance
from 
(select * from runner_orders where distance is not null) as t1
join customer_orders as t2
on t1.order_id = t2.order_id
order by Avg_Distance DESC;

--OR --

select distinct t2.customer_id, cast(avg(t1.distance) as decimal(10, 2)) as Avg_Distance
from 
(select * from runner_orders where distance is not null) as t1
join customer_orders as t2
on t1.order_id = t2.order_id
group by t2.customer_id
order by Avg_Distance DESC;

--5.What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?

select max(duration)-min(duration) as dif_log_shrt 
from runner_orders where duration is not null;

--6.What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

select order_id,runner_id,distance,duration, cast(avg(distance/duration*60) as decimal(10,2)) as speed
	 	from runner_orders where duration is not null
		group by order_id,runner_id,distance,duration
		order by runner_id,speed;
		--Average speed varies from for each runner 1 - (37.5 km/hr to 60 km/hr), 2 - (35.1 km/hr to 93.6 km/hr), 3 - (40 km/hr)

--7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

--(case 1 where all the rows contains null in distance for not delivered)
select runner_id,(count(distance)*100/count(runner_id))::float4 as suc_rate
			from runner_orders
			group by runner_id;
------- OR ------

--(Case 2 for all cases)

select t2.runner_id,
case when t1.not_del is null then 100 else (t2.total-t1.not_del)*100/t2.total end as suc_rate
from (select runner_id,count(cancellation)::float4 as not_del from runner_orders
where cancellation != '' group by runner_id) as t1
right join
(select runner_id,count(runner_id)::float4 as total from runner_orders
group by runner_id) as t2
On t2.runner_id = t1.runner_id
